## About me
My name is Anna Pasyk. I graduated from the University of Agriculture in Cracow with a master's degree in Spatial Economy. Since graduation, I started to interested in software testing. I want to gain experience in this profession because the tester’s job teaches logical thinking and it is more satisfying for me. I'm a self – educated person and open to quickly learning new knowledge. I want to learn how to make software and be part of it. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills. In the future, I want to learn programming and make use of my technical skills to be a good automation tester.
